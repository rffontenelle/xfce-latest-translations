Xfce releases are so super rare (like 3-5 years) so its hard for me as a Xfce translator to test my changes in Xfce.

Building Xfce is to hard for me.

I would like someone to setup a computer to automatically build an iso file like once a month or something with latest Xfce (including latest translations) so i can easily test the translations in VirtualBox.

But so far i have no seen this.

So i made this to help Xfce translations download the latest translations from Transifex, rename the files so they are correct and share a folder in VirtualBox to get the files from the host system to the guest system if needed.

Not perfect because of the software version might not match the version of the translation file but might be usefull untill something better is made.

I test Xfce in Xubuntu 19.04 which seems to be the newest Xfce stuff i can get at the moment.

You can download Xubuntu from https://xubuntu.org/download

You are welcome to help improve this to help the Xfce translators.
